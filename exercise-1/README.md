# Exercise-1

## We are making more changes!

7. Add yet another sentence **at the top of the file** --- for example, a title or subtitle.

8. Commit your change

9. Switch between the experiment and master branches using `git
   checkout <branch name>`.
   Do you see the file contents changing?  Note: _RStudio_, Atom and
   many other editors immeidately notice that branch change and update
   the file accordingly.  In
   some editors you may need to close and re-open the file to see the
   changes.

10. Now `merge` the contents from `experiment` ___into___
    `master`.  Remember you'll want to switch to the `master` branch
    first (the one you are merging ___into___).


## Cheatsheet:

* create new branch: `git checkout -b <new branch name>`
* switch to an existing branch `git checkout <branch name>`  
  (you have to commit first!)
* what branches are there?  `git branch`  
  the current branch is highlighted
